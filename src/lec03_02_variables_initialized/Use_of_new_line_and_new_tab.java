//how to delete a specific line?
//put your cursor at the end, or beginning or middle, and then type 'control/command + d'

//some symbol and characters are used "inside String"
//use of \n --> creating a new line (not next line) ---> a lot of use of \n in IT industry
//use of \t --> creating a tab  ---> a lot of use of \t
//No need to give a space after \n or \t, it will give you a space

//Below 2 is: extra information, not used generally
//use of \b --> creating back space -- not used --- also doesn't work in eclipse (Work in IntelliJ)
//use of \r --> creating carriage return -- not used -- similar like \n
